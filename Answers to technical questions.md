#### How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
It took around 3-4 days to complete technical test solution. If I worked more on that then i would like to use Page Factory framework on that to make it much easier, save the locators as there are many locators having same path only the difference is the name(text).

#### What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?
  The most interesting key trends in test automation is open source and continuous testing. One can test the application continuously  at any time without worrying about the repetition, cost, within time and get the results easily and effectively.

#### How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?
  Implement test automation for legacy applications is a herculean task may not always be practical but has benefits also and to achieve that some suggested approach are:
  * user interface are settled and not updated significantly
  * write automation test script from manual test case
  * Automate GUI and go straight to the backend to test business functionality.
  * Most probably GUI-specific integration tests make it sure that the data from the front-end get to the back end.

  Till now i don't have opportunity to automate any leg application.
